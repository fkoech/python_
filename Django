Initial django setup
-----------------------
-Django project is a collection of setings for an instance of django, including database 
 configuration, Django-specific options and application settings.
-To create a project:
                   $django-admin startproject ProjectName
-Giving project build-in python or django components will conflict with django itself or with built-in python package.
-Unlike php where you put code under the web server's document root(var/www), django you can put it anywhere.
-This can risk you possibility of people viewing you code over the web.

-manage.py - is a command-line utility that lets you interact with django project.
-the inner ProjectName directory is the actual python package for your project.
-python package name you will need to import anything inside it(ProjectName.urls).
-ProjectName/__init__.py - is an empty  file that tells python that this directory should
 be considered a python package.
 -Projectname/settings.py - will tell you all about how setting work.
 
 -To start django development server
                    python manage.py runserver
 -To change the server port 
             python manage.py runserver 8080
 -Django come with utility that automatically genenerate the busic directory structure of an app.
 -An app is a web application that does something eg weblog system, database of public records or
 a small app
 -A project is a collection of configuration and  apps for a particular website. It can contain multiple apps.
 -App should be in the same directory as manage.py file so that it can be imported as its own top-level module rather than submodule of projectName.
 -To create an app 
                python manage.py startapp appName
                
 -path() function is passed four arguments, two required: route and view, and two optional:
  kwargs and name.
 -path() argument: route 
  .route is a string that  contains a URL pattern.
  .when  processing a request, Django starts at the first patern in urlpatterns and makes 
   its way  down the list, comparing the requested URL again each pattern until it finds one that matches.
  .path() argument: view -
  .when django funds a matching pattern, it calls the specified  view function with an 
   HttpRequest object ad first argumen.
  .path() argument: kwargs -
   -arbitrary keyword arguments can be passed in a dictionary to the target view. 
   .path() argument: name
   .Naming your URL lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django. especially from within template.
   .It is a powerful feature that allow you to make global change to the url pattern of your project o
