how computer program works
----------------------------------
-A program makes a computer useful.
-A language is a means(tool) for expressing and recording thoughts.
-computer do have their own language called machine language.
-A computer is the most technically sophisticated, is a devoid
of even a trace of intelligence. It is like a trained dog- it responds only to 
a predetermined set of known commands.
-A complete set of known commands is called an instruction list.
-human language is called natural languages.

What makes a language
-----------------------
-Machine or natural consist of the following elements.
                alphabet
                lexis
                syntax
                semantics
-Alphabet - set of symbols used to build words of a certain language.
-Lexis - set of words the language offers its users.
-Syntax - set of rules(formal and informal) used to 
determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentences.
-Semantics - set of rules determining if a certain phrase make sense.
- high-level programming language is a language which humans can 
write their programs and a language that  computer may use to
execute the prgrams, it is far more complex than machine language and ye
t far simpler than natural language.
-much somewhat similar to natural one in that they use symbols,
words and conventions readable to humans.
-source code is a program written in a high level programming language.

Compilation vs interpretation.
----------------------------------
-Compilation and interpretation is a transformation of a program 
from a high level programming language into machine language.
