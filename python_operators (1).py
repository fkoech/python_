#Hello my people, Fkoech again with another video.
#today we are going to talk about operators in python
# so questions that we should be asking ourselves is that what are operators and how are they useful in our programming journey?
#so we can define operators as symbolic signs that are used to do arithmetic or logical computions.
#So the values that the operators deal with are called operands.
#This operands can be of any datatype depending on the operand to use.
#so operators are classified into various categories and this includes:
         #arithmetic operators
         #logical operators
        #comparison operators
        #special operators such as identity and membership operators and etc

#Arthimetic operators are used to do operations such as the addition, subtraction, multiplications, exponential and modulus operations
#example
x = 400
y = 3032
print(x+y)
print(y-x)
print(x*y)
print(x%y)
print(x**y)


# In[7]:


#Logical operators are used to combine or joint two or more expressions
#Example:
y = 3020
x =3021
print(y<x or y>x)
print(y<x and y>x)
    


# In[10]:


#special operators are identity and membership operator, 
#identity operator are used to check if the value of a variable is the same as the value of another variable
#for example:
y = 20
x = 20
print(y is x)
print(y is not x)


# In[12]:


#membership operator is used to check if certain value is in a given list or directory
# for example:
fruits = ['mangoes','lemon','apple']
list1 = 'apple'
print(list1 in fruits)
